# Real-Time Face Detection with Python and OpenCV
This project demonstrates real-time face detection using Python and OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision and image processing tasks. The program captures video frames from the default camera, converts each frame to grayscale, and applies a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces within the frame. Detected faces are outlined with rectangles, providing a visual indication of their location in the video stream.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to showcase a basic example of how to use computer vision techniques for face detection. Face detection is a fundamental step in many computer vision applications, including facial recognition, emotion detection, and more. The Haar Cascade classifier used in this project is a machine learning-based approach for object detection, particularly well-suited for detecting faces.

## Features
- Simple Implementation: The project provides a straightforward implementation of real-time face detection, suitable for beginners and those new to computer vision.
- OpenCV Integration: Utilizes the OpenCV library, a powerful tool for image and video processing tasks, providing efficient and reliable face detection capabilities.
- Real-Time Feedback: Faces detected in the video stream are outlined with rectangles, providing immediate visual feedback on the detected faces' location.
- Easy to Extend: The project's code can be easily extended or integrated into more complex applications for various purposes, such as facial recognition or emotion detection.
